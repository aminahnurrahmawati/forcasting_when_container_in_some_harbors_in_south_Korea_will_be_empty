# forcasting_when_container_in_some_harbors_in_south_Korea_will_be_empty
Why do we have to use containers when we are going to export and import? Well, to answer this question, of course, we need to know what are the benefits of the container itself. The benefits of containers from 3 user points of view:      
1.  Benefits for Shippers  :
– Reduce transportation costs  
– Save on port fees  
– Reduce warehousing and inventory costs  
– Reduce packing costs  
– Reduce insurance premiums  
-  More comfortable  
– Easier and better reception (port)  
– The emergence of new markets         
2. Benefits for Shipowners   :
– Speed ​​up turnaround time  
– More cargo carrying capacity  
– High return on investment  
– Global contracts     
– Higher profitability  
– Inland operations         
3. Benefits for port authorities :
– Reduce port congestion  
- Saving time  
– Fast and convenient loading and unloading  
– Less marketing effort  
– Rationalization of cargo handling costs

So, to optimize the function of the available container, I apply the Machine Learning algorithm Multiple Linear Regregression-
to predict when will the container will be empty using Python Programming Language. I use the container dataset of harbors in South Korea.
